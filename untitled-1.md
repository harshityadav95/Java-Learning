### Model View Controller Design Pattern

* Data access layer
* Service Layer
* Presentation Layer 



## Spring Boot  

* Inversion of Control 
* Dependency Injection 

### Spring Framework

* Relies heavily on Inversion of Control 
* Build using POJO - plain old java object
* Spring works with java Standard edition
* POJO+ configuration Metadata = Spring container 
* A Spring bean is a basic building block that is managed by Spring Framework
* Spring is responsible for creating and destorying beans
* Providing dependencies  of the bean which could be other beans or configuration properties
* Intercepting Bean method calls to include additional framework features

### What makes spring powerful ?

* How it manages dependencies
* Design patters are responsibility of developers , solution Inversion of Control  ie role of managing depedencies is handled over to Spring framework 

### What is Inversion of Control  \(IoC\) ?

A process by which  objects define their dependencies and an external container injects those dependencies into the object
