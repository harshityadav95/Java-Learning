# 2. User Input

### A. Using Buffered Reader Class

* The input is buffered for efficient reading.
* The wrapping code is hard to remember.

```text

// Java program to demonstrate BufferedReader
import java.io.BufferedReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.io.InputStreamReader;
public class Test {
    public static void main(String[] args)
        throws IOException
    {
        // Enter data using BufferReader
        BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(
            new InputStreamReader(System.in));
 
        // Reading data using readLine
        String name = reader.readLine();
 
        // Printing the read line
        System.out.println(name);
    }
}
```

### B. Using Scanner Class

* Convenient methods for parsing primitives 

  * nextInt\(\)
  *  nextFloat\(\)

* Regular expressions can be used to find tokens.
* The reading methods are not synchronized
* Dont Forget to close the Scanner Class

```text
// Java program to demonstrate working of Scanner in Java
import java.util.Scanner;

class GetInputFromUser {
	public static void main(String args[])
	{
		// Using Scanner for Getting Input from User
		Scanner in = new Scanner(System.in);

		String s = in.nextLine();
		System.out.println("You entered string " + s);

		int a = in.nextInt();
		System.out.println("You entered integer " + a);

		float b = in.nextFloat();
		System.out.println("You entered float " + b);
	
		// closing scanner
		in.close();
	}
}

```

#### Invisible "\n" newlines

At the end of each line of the provided input, there is an invisible "\n" which is called a newline character. This basically represents what happens when you press the "Enter" key when typing.

1\) The first scan.nextInt\(\) grabs the first "int" from the input. It still leaves the "\n" on that line.

2\) The second scan.nextDouble\(\) skips over that "\n" and grabs the first "double" it sees.

**3\) Now is the tricky part. It turns out scan.nextLine\(\) works differently than scan.nextInt\(\) and scan.nextDouble\(\) in that it doesn't skip over any "\n" newline characters. What it does is it reads and returns all characters until it reaches the "\n" \(which it gets rid of\), and stops. In the scenario above, since "\n" is the first thing we see, we get an empty String back on our 1st call to scan.nextLine\(\)**.

4\) Our next call to scan.nextLine\(\) will start on line 3 of input and grab the String we want.

Hope this helps.

```text
 Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
        int i = scan.nextInt();
        double d=scan.nextDouble();
        scan.nextLine();
        String s=scan.nextLine();
```

### C. Using Console Class

* Reading password without echoing the entered characters.
* Reading methods are synchronized.
* Format string syntax can be used.
* Does not work in non-interactive environment \(such as in an IDE\)

```text
// Java program to demonstrate working of System.console()
// Note that this program does not work on IDEs as
// System.console() may require console
public class Sample {
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		// Using Console to input data from user
		String name = System.console().readLine();

		System.out.println("You entered string " + name);
	}
}

```

### D. Using Command Line Args

* Most used user input for competitive coding. 
* The command-line arguments are stored in the String format. 
* The parseInt method of the Integer class converts string argument into Integer.
*  Similarly, for float and others during execution. 
* The usage of args\[\] comes into existence in this input form. 
* The passing of information takes place during the program run. 
* The command line is given to args\[\]. 
* These programs have to be run on cmd.

```text
// Program to check for command line arguments
class Hello {
	public static void main(String[] args)
	{
		// check if length of args array is
		// greater than 0
		if (args.length > 0) {
			System.out.println(
				"The command line arguments are:");

			// iterating the args array and printing
			// the command line arguments
			for (String val : args)
				System.out.println(val);
		}
		else
			System.out.println("No command line "
							+ "arguments found.");
	}
}

```

```text
javac GFG1.java
java Main Hello World
```
