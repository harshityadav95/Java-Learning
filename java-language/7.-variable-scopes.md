# 7. Variable Scopes

## What is Variable Scope

```text
public static void func () {
    int a = 5;
    a = a + 10;
    System.out.println(a);
}
```

In the above code snippet, the **variable**, is declared and initialized inside the method named **`func`** . Hence, the scope of the variable **`a`** is **ONLY** inside this particular method **`func`** , and the region is the area enclosed within the **curly braces**.

## Method Scope in Java

Before jumping on scope, one important thing worth mentioning is there is **NO pass-by reference** in _**Java**_. The only thing that exists in Java for passing argument values to parameters at the time of function call is to[ pass **by VALUE**](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2012/12/does-java-pass-by-value-or-pass-by-reference.html)

## Block Scopes

* **Case 1 :-** The variable _**`outsideBlock`**_ is already defined and initialized outside the block. So we cannot declare and initialize a new variable with the same name _**`outsideBlock`**_ inside the block.
* **Case 2 :-** The **scope** of the variable _**`outsideBlock`**_ is the **entire** _**region**_ inside the **`main`** _**method**_. So, once the variable is initialized, can be accessed and modified/updated from anywhere inside the main method. Even from _**inside** the block_ as the block is also placed inside the **body** of the [main method](http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2011/12/main-public-static-java-void-method-why.html#axzz4uMEUqg5v).
* **Case 3:-** The scope of the variable _**`insideBlock`**_ is limited only inside the block. So, whenever we try to access the variable outside the block, Java can’t find any variable with that particular name and throws an error stating variable not declared.
* **Case 4:-** It is linked with case 3. Java can’t find a variable named _**`insideBlock`**_ and thinks as if no variable with that name ever existed. So, now if we declare and initialize a new variable and give it a name as _**`insideBlock`**_, Java will treat this as a newly declared and initialized variable only with no prior connection with the one residing inside the block.
