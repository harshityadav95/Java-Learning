# 9. Date Time

The [Calendar class](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/Calendar.html) is an abstract class that provides methods for converting between a specific instant in time and a set of calendar fields such as YEAR, MONTH, DAY\_OF\_MONTH, HOUR, and so on, and for manipulating the calendar fields, such as getting the date of the next week.

```text
    public static String findDay(int month, int day, int year) {
        
        LocalDate dt = LocalDate.of(year,month,day);
        String s=dt.getDayOfWeek().toString();
        return s;
        
    }
```
