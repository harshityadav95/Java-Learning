# 0. Naming Convention

### Naming Convention 

* **Package** — names `com.deepspace` over `com.deepSpace` or `com.deep_space`
* **File** — names are `CamelCase` and end with `.java` matching the class name. There is one `public` class per file with each top-level class in its file
* **Method** — names should be `verbs` in mixed case with each internal word capitalized for example `run();` or `runFast();`
* **Constants** — should be uppercase with “\_” separating each words for example `int MIN_WIDTH = 44;` and `int MAX_WIDTH = 99;`
* **Variable** — a name that tells the reader of the program what the variable represents i.e. if you are storing a test grade then pick `grade` vs `var1` . Keep the variable names short avoid including metadata.
